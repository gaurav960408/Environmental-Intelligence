    "The API response provides an estimated usage of 766968 bytes per API call when querying the Above Ground Biomass data for a 10,000-hectare plot in Brazil for the year 2023. Please note that the usage estimate increases with the addition of historical years and expansion of spatial area within the query. However, the estimate remains unchanged when future years are added, as it is calculated based on the historical years available in the query for which data exists.\n",
